          <p class="mt-5">
            Our client, a large international insurance company, was looking to
            increase the engagement and satisfaction of their customers by
            providing 24/7 customer support. However, offering such support is
            costly, prompting them to investigate other options. Consequently,
            they approached ADC to investigate the possibility of using
            LLM-powered chatbots to help alleviate the pressure on their support
            desks and obtain a highly tailored solution that would comply with
            their corporate values while also engaging their customers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-10">
          <h2 class="text-4xl font-normal">Approach</h2>
          <p class="mt-5">
            Since LLM-powered chatbots are still in the beginning phase of their
            maturity cycle, we started with creating multiple context-aware
            chatbots for different support domains. For each of these domains,
            it was necessary to first evaluate the regulations and policies
            related to AI and make sure that our solution would be fully
            compliant.

            <br />
            <br />
            Subsequently, we determined the functional requirements of the
            chatbots. We then translated these into technical and implementation
            requirements relating to the architecture of the chatbot setup and
            required infrastructure. Afterward, we developed a minimum viable
            chatbot (MVC) for each domain. These MVCs were then tested through a
            phased testing approach where each phase was increasingly more
            public.

        </div>

        <div class="mt-10">
          <h2 class="text-4xl font-normal">Implementation & Solution</h2>
          <h4 class="font-semibold mt-5">Functional Requirements</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            In collaboration with the client, we established the functional
            requirements of a customer-facing chatbot. At a high level, these
            include:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-6 ml-6 list-disc">
            <li>
              Performance – Ensuring accurate and relevant responses in an
              appropriate tone, while filtering out any potentially harmful or
              biased content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flexibility – Adapting solutions quickly and easily in the
              fast-evolving environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data Privacy & Ownership – Prioritising sole client ownership of
              the data and preventing externals having access to it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="font-semibold mt-5">
            Technical & Implementation Requirements
          </h4>
          <p class="mt-2">
            To ensure our chatbot met the performance requirements, we opted for
            a setup using two language models (LLMs), with the first one
            enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This ‘vanilla LLM’
            augmented with RAG empowers the chatbot with specific domain
            knowledge, allowing it to provide accurate and relevant answers
            based on context provided by the system developer.
            <br />
            <br />
            To address concerns about tone, harmful content, and biases, we
            implemented a second LLM to review and refine responses before
            reaching the end user. Leveraging our client’s existing use of Azure
            and Office 365, we chose Azure cloud for this design. The focus on
            accuracy, relevancy, tone, and content filtering set our
            architecture apart from a straightforward call to the OpenAI service
            in Azure.

            <br />
            <br />
            For flexibility, we decided to implement and maintain the solution
            with a mix of our internal team and external developers. This,
            coupled with the use of the RAG framework, allows easy modification
            of chatbot behaviour by updating prompts and context. Lastly, to
            ensure data privacy, we decided to host the solution on our client’s
            cloud servers and virtual network.
          </p>
          <h4 class="font-semibold mt-5">
            Minimum Viable Chatbot (MVC) Development & Testing Phase
          </h4>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Like any customer-facing product, implementing a well-structured
            incremental testing and roll-out plan was important. So, we worked
            with a three-phased plan. Following each phase, a dedicated
            committee evaluated the results and decided whether the chatbots
            were ready for the next testing phase or required further
            refinement.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the first phase, the chatbots were only made available to
            internal developers, who could access them via a private link with a
            username and password log-in. The developers were encouraged to test
            the chatbots, trying to prompt inadequate responses to simulate a
            worst-case scenario involving a user with malicious intent.
            <br /><br />The second phase extended access to friends and family,
            focusing on refining legal disclaimers on the front-end and
            qualitative aspects like tone of voice and user-friendliness. The
            final phase was a limited roll-out, where the chatbots were made
            available to a select number of customers.
          </p>
          <h4 class="font-semibold mt-5">Final Deliverable</h4>
          <p class="mt-2">
            For each domain, the client received a user-friendly front-end where
            the customer can interact with the chatbot, a robust back-end with
            the infrastructure to host the system and log interactions, and
            documentation covering the entire system.

            >Figure 1. Three chatbot architectures of increasing complexity. The
            leftmost architecture is the simplest but lacks content and does not

          <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 font-normal">Impact for Client</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Through this project, our client achieved significant milestones,
            including 24/7 customer support on multiple customer support
            domains, setting them apart from competitors in customer service.
            Additionally, they now have a tool that sustains user engagement on
            targeted domains and provides information in a natural and simple
            way. Importantly, the project successfully mitigated potential risks
            associated with the technology, while complying with corporate
            policies.
            <br />
            <br />
            These steps pave the way for further innovations. The chatbots could
            be rolled out to other parts of the business. Furthermore, the
            existing use-cases could be extended and improved. What if – for
            example – one could use AI to determine when a customer is better
            serviced by a human? Then the AI system could handle the main body
            of questions, but for specific questions, a human could be brought
            into the loop. The possibilities for future innovations are
            extensive, opening avenues for continued growth and success.

          <h2 class="text-4xl mt-10 font-normal">Learnings & Challenges</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Every project brings many insights, and here, we will highlight
            three key learnings:
          </p>
          <ol class="mt-4 ml-6 list-decimal">
            <li>
              Risk management and compliancy should be considered by design.
              This means that relevant stakeholders should already be included
              from the design phase onwards, and the developers should be aware
              of the relevant organisation policies and values throughout the
              process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since the chatbot heavily relies on the context it receives,
              ensuring its accuracy and high quality is important. Furthermore,
              the chatbot should refrain from providing information beyond its
              given context. Achieving these required significant adjustments to
              both the architecture and context. Simple changes in instructions
              can have a big effect on outcomes, so it pays off to take time for
              experimentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The project demonstrates that it’s possible to safely deploy
              high-quality customer facing chatbots. This is relevant for a
              variety of organisations.
